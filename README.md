# Instructions for running Wilderness

You'll need the Exidy Sorcer emulator http://www.liaquay.co.uk/sorcerer/instructions.html

The file you need from this repo is: 
https://github.com/dukedougal/wilderness/blob/main/Wilderness-(Dick%20Smith%20Electronics)-BASIC-Sorcerer-1200.wav

This is a wav file that contains the audio of the cassette tape of Wilderness.



In the Exidy Sorcer emulator, click on the ROM icon and load up the "Exidy Standard Basic" ROM then click on the cassette icon and choose the wav file above to load the 1200 baud Wilderness WAV file.  Then type cload and hit return.  After a few seconds the prompt will reappear.

Once the prompt has reappeared type run

# IMPORTANT!

The instructions in the game don't tell you some important things:

1: in the underworld, to move between rooms type M/roomnumber where roomnumber is the number of the room you wish to move to.

2: In the underworld, you need to either write down the rooms that you can move to, or you can hit the V key to see "rooms visited in order" and mve back to a room you were previously in.

3: to cast a spell, type CA/spellnumber - this is not in the instructions
